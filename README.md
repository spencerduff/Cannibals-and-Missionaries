# Cannibals-and-Missionaries
Solves the problem of getting cannibals and missionaries across a river

You have 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals on the side of a river. They want to cross to the other side. There is one boat that can
hold 2 people at a time. If the cannibals ever out-number the missionaries, then they'll eat them and you lose. 
Get all 6 people to the other side safely to win.
